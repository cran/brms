#' Fit Bayesian Generalized (Non-)Linear Multilevel Models
#' 
#' Fit a Bayesian generalized (non-)linear Multilevel model using Stan
#' 
#' @param formula An object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class): 
#'   a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. 
#'   The details of model specification are given under 'Details'.
#' @param data An optional data frame, list or environment  (or object coercible by 
#'   \code{as.data.frame} to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. 
#'   If not found in data, the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}, 
#'   typically the environment from which \code{brm} is called. 
#'   Although it is optional, we strongly recommend to supply a data.frame. 
#' @param family A description of the error distribution and link function 
#'   to be used in the model. This can be a family function, 
#'   a call to a family function or a character string naming the family.
#'   Currently, the following families are supported:
#'   \code{gaussian}, \code{student}, \code{cauchy} (deprecated), \code{binomial}, 
#'   \code{bernoulli}, \code{Beta}, \code{poisson}, \code{negbinomial}, 
#'   \code{geometric}, \code{Gamma}, \code{inverse.gaussian}, 
#'   \code{exponential}, \code{weibull}, \code{categorical}, \code{cumulative}, 
#'   \code{cratio}, \code{sratio}, \code{acat}, \code{hurdle_poisson}, 
#'   \code{hurdle_negbinomial}, \code{hurdle_gamma}, \code{zero_inflated_binomial},
#'   \code{zero_inflated_beta}, \cr \code{zero_inflated_negbinomial}, 
#'   and \code{zero_inflated_poisson}.
#'   Every family function has a \code{link} argument allowing to specify
#'   the link function to be applied on the response variable.
#'   If not specified, default links are used.
#'   See \code{\link[stats:family]{family}} for help on standard family functions 
#'   and \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brmsfamily}} for family functions
#'   specific to the \pkg{brms} package. 
#'   For backwards compatibility, \code{family} may also be a vector of two
#'   character strings, the first naming the family and the second naming the link.
#'   Further information is provided under 'Details'.
#' @param prior One or more \code{brmsprior} objects created by function 
#'   \code{\link[brms:set_prior]{set_prior}} and combined using the \code{c} method. 
#'   A single \code{brmsprior} object may be passed without \code{c()} surrounding it. 
#'   See also  \code{\link[brms:get_prior]{get_prior}} for more help.
#' @param autocor An optional \code{\link{cor_brms}} object describing 
#'   the correlation structure 
#'   within the response variable (i.e. the 'autocorrelation'). 
#'   See the documentation of \code{\link{cor_brms}} for a description 
#'   of the available correlation structures. Defaults to NULL, 
#'   corresponding to no correlations.
#' @param nonlinear An optional list of formuluas, specifying 
#'   linear models for non-linear parameters. If \code{NULL} (the default)
#'   \code{formula} is treated as an ordinary formula. 
#'   If not \code{NULL}, \code{formula} is treated as a non-linear model
#'   and \code{nonlinear} should contain a formula for each non-linear 
#'   parameter, which has the parameter on the left hand side and its
#'   linear predictor on the right hand side.
#'   Alternatively, it can be a single formula with all non-linear
#'   parameters on the left hand side (separated by a \code{+}) and a
#'   common linear predictor on the right hand side.
#'   More information is given under 'Details'.
#' @param partial (Deprecated) A one sided formula of the form 
#'   \code{~expression} allowing to specify predictors with 
#'   category specific effects in non-cumulative ordinal models 
#'   (i.e. in families \code{cratio}, \code{sratio}, or \code{acat}).
#'   As of \pkg{brms} > 0.8.0 category specific effects should be 
#'   specified directly within \code{formula} using function \code{cse}.
#' @param threshold A character string indicating the type of thresholds 
#'   (i.e. intercepts) used in an ordinal model. 
#'   \code{"flexible"} provides the standard unstructured thresholds and 
#'   \code{"equidistant"} restricts the distance between 
#'   consecutive thresholds to the same value.
#' @param sparse Logical; indicates whether the fixed effects design matrix
#'   should be treated as sparse (defaults to \code{FALSE}). 
#'   For design matrices with many zeros, this can considerably 
#'   reduce required memory. For all models using multivariate syntax 
#'   (i.e. multivariate linear models, zero-inflated and hurdle models 
#'   as well as categorical models), setting \code{sparse = TRUE}, 
#'   is generally worth a try to decrease memory requirements.
#'   However, sampling speed is currently not improved or even
#'   slightly decreased.
#' @param cov_ranef A list of matrices that are proportional to the 
#'   (within) covariance structure of the random effects. 
#'   The names of the matrices should correspond to columns 
#'   in \code{data} that are used as grouping factors. 
#'   All levels of the grouping factor should appear as rownames 
#'   of the corresponding matrix. This argument can be used,
#'   among others, to model pedigrees and phylogenetic effects.
#' @param ranef A flag to indicate if random effects 
#'   for each level of the grouping factor(s) 
#'   should be saved (default is \code{TRUE}). 
#'   Set to \code{FALSE} to save memory. 
#'   The argument has no impact on the model fitting itself.
#' @param sample_prior A flag to indicate if samples from all specified 
#'   proper priors should be drawn additionally to the posterior samples
#'   (defaults to \code{FALSE}). Among others, these samples can be used 
#'   to calculate Bayes factors for point hypotheses. 
#'   Alternatively, \code{sample_prior} can be set to \code{"only"} to
#'   sample solely from the priors. In this case, all parameters must 
#'   have proper priors.
#' @param stan_funs An optional character string containing self-defined 
#'   \pkg{Stan} functions, which will be included in the functions block 
#'   of the generated \pkg{Stan} code. 
#' @param fit An instance of S3 class \code{brmsfit} derived from a previous fit; 
#'   defaults to \code{NA}. 
#'   If \code{fit} is of class \code{brmsfit}, the compiled model associated 
#'   with the fitted result is re-used and all arguments 
#'   modifying the model code or data are ignored.
#' @param inits Either \code{"random"} or \code{"0"}. 
#'   If inits is \code{"random"} (the default), 
#'   Stan will randomly generate initial values for parameters. 
#'   If it is \code{"0"}, all parameters are initiliazed to zero. 
#'   This option is recommended for \code{exponential} and \code{weibull} models, 
#'   as it happens that default (\code{"random"}) inits cause samples 
#'   to be essentially constant. 
#'   Generally, setting \code{inits = "0"} is worth a try, 
#'   if chains do not behave well.
#'   Alternatively, \code{inits} can be a list of lists containing 
#'   the initial values, or a function (or function name) generating initial values. 
#'   The latter options are mainly implemented for internal testing.
#' @param chains Number of Markov chains (defaults to 4). 
#'   A deprecated alias is \code{n.chains}.
#' @param iter Number of total iterations per chain (including warmup; defaults to 2000).
#'   A deprecated alias is \code{n.iter}.
#' @param warmup A positive integer specifying number of warmup (aka burnin) iterations. 
#'   This also specifies the number of iterations used for stepsize adaptation, 
#'   so warmup samples should not be used for inference. The number of warmup should not 
#'   be larger than \code{iter} and the default is \code{iter/2}.
#'   A deprecated alias is \code{n.warmup}.
#' @param thin Thinning rate. Must be a positive integer. 
#'   Set \code{thin > 1} to save memory and computation time if \code{iter} is large. 
#'   Default is 1, that is no thinning. A deprecated alias is \code{n.thin}.
#' @param cluster	Number of clusters to use to run parallel chains. Default is 1.  
#'   A deprecated alias is \code{n.cluster}. To use the built-in parallel execution
#'   of \pkg{rstan}, specify argument \code{cores} instead of \code{cluster}. 
#' @param cluster_type A character string specifying the type of cluster created by 
#'   \code{\link[parallel:makeCluster]{makeCluster}} when sampling in parallel 
#'   (i.e. when \code{cluster} is greater \code{1}). 
#'   Default is \code{"PSOCK"} working on all platforms. 
#'   For OS X and Linux, \code{"FORK"} may be a faster and more stable option, 
#'   but it does not work on Windows.
#' @param save_model Either \code{NULL} or a character string. 
#'   In the latter case, the model code is
#'   saved in a file named after the string supplied in \code{save_model}, 
#'   which may also contain the full path where to save the file.
#'   If only a name is given, the file is saved in the current working directory. 
#' @param algorithm Character string indicating the estimation approach to use. 
#'   Can be \code{"sampling"} for MCMC (the default), \code{"meanfield"} for
#'   variational inference with independent normal distributions, or
#'   \code{"fullrank"} for variational inference with a multivariate normal
#'   distribution.
#' @param control A named \code{list} of parameters to control the sampler's behavior. 
#'   It defaults to \code{NULL} so all the default values are used. 
#'   The most important control parameters are discussed in the 'Details'
#'   section below. For a comprehensive overview see \code{\link[rstan:stan]{stan}}.
#' @param silent logical; If \code{TRUE}, warning messages of the sampler are suppressed.
#' @param seed Positive integer. Used by \code{set.seed} to make results reproducable.  
#' @param ... Further arguments to be passed to Stan.
#' 
#' @return An object of class \code{brmsfit}, which contains the posterior samples along 
#'   with many other useful information about the model.
#'   Use \code{methods(class = "brmsfit")} for an overview on available methods.

#' @details Fit a generalized (non-)linear multilevel model, 
#'   which incorporates both population-level parameters 
#'   (also known as fixed-effects) and group-level parameters
#'   (also known as random effects) in a (non-)linear predictor 
#'   via full Bayesian inference using Stan. 
#'   
#'   \bold{Formula syntax for multilevel models}
#'   
#'   The \code{formula} argument accepts formulas of the following syntax: 
#'   
#'   \code{response | addition ~ fixed + (random | group)} 
#'   
#'   The \code{fixed} term contains effects that are assumend to be the 
#'   same across obervations. We call them 'population-level' effects
#'   or (adopting frequentist vocabulary) 'fixed' effects. The optional
#'   \code{random} terms may contain effects that are assumed to vary
#'   accross grouping variables specified in \code{group}. We
#'   call them 'group-level' effects or (adopting frequentist 
#'   vocabulary) 'random' effects, although the latter name is misleading
#'   in a Bayesian context (for more details type \code{vignette("brms")}).
#'   Multiple grouping factors each with multiple group-level effects 
#'   are possible. Instead of | you may use || in grouping terms
#'   to prevent correlations from being modeled. With two exceptions, 
#'   this is basically \code{lme4} syntax. 
#'   
#'   The first exception is that \code{fixed} may contain two non-standard types
#'   of population-level effects namely monotonous and category specific effects,
#'   which can be specified using terms of the form \code{monotonous(<predictors>)} 
#'   and \code{cse(<predictors>)} respectively. The latter can only be applied in
#'   ordinal models and is explained in more detail in the package's vignette
#'   (type \code{vignette("brms")}). The former effect type is explained here.
#'   A monotonous predictor must either be integer valued or an ordered factor, 
#'   which is the first difference to an ordinary continuous predictor. 
#'   More importantly, predictor categories (or integers) are not assumend to be 
#'   equidistant with respect to their effect on the response variable. 
#'   Instead, the distance between adjacent predictor categories (or integers) 
#'   is estimated from the data and may vary across categories. 
#'   This is realized by parameterizing as follows: 
#'   One parameter takes care of the direction and size of the effect similar 
#'   to an ordinary regression parameter, while an additional parameter vector 
#'   estimates the normalized distances between consecutive predictor categories.     
#'   A main application of monotonous effects are ordinal predictors that
#'   can this way be modeled without (falsely) treating them as continuous
#'   or as unordered categorical predictors.
#'   
#'   The second eception is the optional \code{addition} term, which may contain 
#'   multiple terms of the form \code{fun(variable)} seperated by \code{+} each 
#'   providing special information on the response variable. 
#'   \code{fun} can be replaced with either \code{se}, \code{weights}, \code{disp}, \code{trials},
#'   \code{cat}, \code{cens}, or \code{trunc}. Their meanings are explained below. 
#'   
#'   For families \code{gaussian}, \code{student}, and \code{cauchy} it is possible to specify
#'   standard errors of the observation, thus allowing to perform meta-analysis. 
#'   Suppose that the variable \code{yi} contains the effect sizes from the studies 
#'   and \code{sei} the corresponding standard errors. 
#'   Then, fixed and random effects meta-analyses can be conducted
#'   using the formulae \code{yi | se(sei) ~ 1} and 
#'   \code{yi | se(sei) ~ 1 + (1|study)}, respectively, where 
#'   \code{study} is a variable uniquely identifying every study.
#'   If desired, meta-regression can be performed via 
#'   \code{yi | se(sei) ~ 1 + mod1 + mod2 + (1|study)} 
#'   or \cr \code{yi | se(sei) ~ 1 + mod1 + mod2 + (1 + mod1 + mod2|study)}, where
#'   \code{mod1} and \code{mod2} represent moderator variables. 
#'   
#'   For all families, weighted regression may be performed using
#'   \code{weights} in the addition part. Internally, this is 
#'   implemented by multiplying the log-posterior values of each 
#'   observation by their corresponding weights.
#'   Suppose that variable \code{wei} contains the weights 
#'   and that \code{yi} is the response variable. 
#'   Then, formula \code{yi | weights(wei) ~ predictors} 
#'   implements a weighted regression. 
#'   
#'   The addition argument \code{disp} (short for dispersion) serves a
#'   similar purpose than \code{weight}. However, it has a different 
#'   implementation and is less general as it is only usable for the
#'   families \code{gaussian}, \code{student}, \code{cauchy},
#'   \code{Gamma}, \code{weibull}, and \code{negbinomial}.
#'   For the former three families, the residual standard deviation 
#'   \code{sigma} is multiplied by the values given in 
#'   \code{disp}, so that higher values lead to lower weights.
#'   Contrariwise, for the latter three families, the parameter \code{shape}
#'   is multiplied by the values given in \code{disp}. As \code{shape}
#'   can be understood as a precision parameter (inverse of the variance),
#'   higher values will lead to higher weights in this case.
#'   
#'   For families \code{binomial} and \code{zero_inflated_binomial}, 
#'   addition should contain a variable indicating the number of trials 
#'   underlying each observation. In \code{lme4} syntax, we may write for instance 
#'   \code{cbind(success, n - success)}, which is equivalent
#'   to \code{success | trials(n)} in \code{brms} syntax. If the number of trials
#'   is constant across all observation (say \code{10}), 
#'   we may also write \code{success | trials(10)}. 
#'   
#'   For family \code{categorical} and all ordinal families, 
#'   \code{addition} may contain a term \code{cat(number)} to
#'   specify the number categories (e.g, \code{cat(7)}). 
#'   If not given, the number of categories is calculated from the data.
#'   
#'   With the expection of \code{categorical} and ordinal families, left and right censoring 
#'   can be modeled through \code{yi | cens(censored) ~ predictors}.
#'   The censoring variable (named \code{censored} in this example) should 
#'   contain the values \code{'left'}, \code{'none'}, and \code{'right'}  
#'   (or equivalenty -1, 0, and 1) to indicate that the corresponding observation is 
#'   left censored, not censored, or right censored. 
#'   
#'   With the expection of \code{categorical} and ordinal families, the response 
#'   distribution can be truncated using the \code{trunc} function in the addition part.
#'   If the response variable is truncated between, say, 0 and 100, we can specify this via
#'   \code{yi | trunc(lb = 0, ub = 100) ~ predictors}. Defining only one of the two arguments 
#'   in \code{trunc} leads to one-sided truncation.
#' 
#'   Mutiple \code{addition} terms may be specified at the same time using 
#'   the \code{+} operator, for instance \code{formula = yi | se(sei) + cens(censored) ~ 1} 
#'   for a censored meta-analytic model. \cr
#'   
#'   For families \code{gaussian}, \code{student}, and \code{cauchy} 
#'   multivariate models may be specified using \code{cbind} notation. 
#'   Suppose that \code{y1} and \code{y2} are response variables 
#'   and \code{x} is a predictor.
#'   Then \code{cbind(y1,y2) ~ x} specifies a multivariate model, 
#'   where \code{x} has the same effect on \code{y1} and \code{y2}.
#'   To indicate different effects on each response variable, 
#'   the factor \code{trait} (which is reserved in multivariate models) 
#'   can be used as an additional predictor. 
#'   For instance, \code{cbind(y1,y2) ~ 0 + trait + x:trait} leads to seperate effects
#'   of \code{x} on \code{y1} and \code{y2} as well as to separate intercepts. 
#'   In this case, \code{trait} has two levels, namely \code{"y1"} and \code{"y2"}. 
#'   It may also be used within random effects terms, both as grouping factor or 
#'   as random effect within a grouping factor. Note that variable \code{trait} is generated 
#'   internally and may not be specified in the data passed to \code{brm}. \cr
#'   
#'   As of \pkg{brms} 0.9.0, categorical models use the same syntax as multivariate
#'   models, but in this case, \code{trait} differentiates between the response 
#'   categories. As in most other implementations of categorical models,
#'   values of one category are fixed to identify the model. 
#'   Accordingly, \code{trait} has \code{K - 1} levels, 
#'   where \code{K} is the number of categories. 
#'   Usually, it makes most sense to use terms of the structure
#'   \code{0 + trait + trait:(<predictors>)}.
#'   
#'   Zero-inflated and hurdle families are bivariate and also make use 
#'   of the special internal variable \code{trait} having two levels in this case. 
#'   However, only the actual response must be specified in \code{formula}, 
#'   as the second response variable used for the zero-inflation / hurdle
#'   (ZIH) part is internally generated.
#'   A \code{formula} for this type of models may, for instance, look like this: \cr
#'   \code{y ~ 0 + trait + trait:(x1 + x2) + (0 + trait | g)}. 
#'   In this example, the predictors \code{x1} and \code{x1} influence the ZIH part 
#'   differentlythan the actual response part as indicated by their 
#'   interaction with \code{trait}.
#'   In addition, a group-level effect of \code{trait} was added while 
#'   the group-level intercept was removed leading to the estimation of 
#'   two effects, one for the ZIH part and one for the actual response. 
#'   In the example above, the correlation between the two effects
#'   will also be estimated.
#'   Sometimes, predictors should only influence the ZIH part
#'   but not the actual response (or vice versa). As this cannot be modeled
#'   with the \code{trait} variable, two other internally generated and 
#'   reserved (numeric) variables, namely \code{main} and \code{spec}, are supported.
#'   \code{main} is \code{1} for the response part and \code{0} for the
#'   ZIH part of the model. For \code{spec} it is the other way round.
#'   Suppose that \code{x1} should only influence the actual response,
#'   and \code{x2} only the ZIH process. We can write this as follows:
#'   \code{formula = y ~ 0 + main + spec + main:x1 + spec:x2}. 
#'   The main effects of \code{main} or \code{spec} serve as intercepts,
#'   while the interaction terms \code{main:x1} and \code{spec:x2} ensure
#'   that \code{x1} and \code{x2} only predict one part of the model, respectively.
#'   
#'   Using the same syntax as for zero-inflated and hurdle models, it is
#'   possible to specify multiplicative effects in family \code{bernoulli}
#'   (make sure to set argument \code{type} to \code{"2PL"}; 
#'   see \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brmsfamily}} for more details).
#'   In Item Response Theory (IRT), these models are known as 2PL models.
#'   Suppose that we have the variables \code{item} and \code{person} and
#'   want to model fixed effects for items and random effects for persons.
#'   The discriminality (multiplicative effect) should depend only on the items. 
#'   We can specify this by setting
#'   \code{formula = response ~ 0 + (main + spec):item + (0 + main|person)}. 
#'   The random term \code{0 + main} ensures that \code{person} does 
#'   not influence discriminalities. Of course it is possible
#'   to predict only discriminalities by using
#'   variable \code{spec} in the model formulation. 
#'   To identify the model, multiplicative effects are estimated on the log scale. 
#'   In addition, we strongly recommend setting proper priors 
#'   on fixed effects in this case to increase sampling efficiency 
#'   (for details on priors see \code{\link[brms:set_prior]{set_prior}}).     
#'   
#'   \bold{Parameterization of the population-level intercept}
#'   
#'   The population-level intercept (if incorporated) is estimated separately 
#'   and not as part of population-level parameter vector \code{b}. 
#'   This has the side effect that priors on the intercept 
#'   also have to be specified separately
#'   (see \code{\link[brms:set_prior]{set_prior}} for more details).
#'   Furthermore, to increase sampling efficiency, the fixed effects 
#'   design matrix \code{X} is centered around its column means 
#'   \code{X_means} if the intercept is incorporated. 
#'   This leads to a temporary bias in the intercept equal to 
#'   \code{<X_means, b>}, where \code{<,>} is the scalar product. 
#'   The bias is corrected after fitting the model, but be aware 
#'   that you are effectively defining a prior on the temporary
#'   intercept of the centered design matrix not on the real intercept.
#'   
#'   This behavior can be avoided by using the reserved 
#'   (and internally generated) variable \code{intercept}. 
#'   Instead of \code{y ~ x}, you may write
#'   \code{y ~ -1 + intercept + x}. This way, priors can be
#'   defined on the real intercept, directly. In addition,
#'   the intercept is just treated as an ordinary fixed effect
#'   and thus priors defined on \code{b} will also apply to it. 
#'   Note that this parameterization may be a bit less efficient
#'   than the default parameterization discussed above.  
#'   
#'   \bold{Formula syntax for non-linear multilevel models}
#'   
#'   Using the \code{nonlinear} argument, it is possible to specify
#'   non-linear models in \pkg{brms}. Contrary to what the name might suggest,
#'   \code{nonlinear} should not contain the non-linear model itself
#'   but rather information on the non-linear parameters. 
#'   The non-linear model will just be specified within the \code{formula}
#'   argument. Suppose, that we want to predict the response \code{y}
#'   through the predictor \code{x}, where \code{x} is linked to \code{y}
#'   through \code{y = alpha - beta * lambda^x}, with parameters
#'   \code{alpha}, \code{beta}, and \code{lambda}. This is certainly a
#'   non-linear model being defined via
#'   \code{formula = y ~ alpha - beta * lambda^x} (addition arguments 
#'   can be added in the same way as for ordinary formulas).
#'   Now we have to tell \pkg{brms} the names of the non-linear parameters 
#'   and specfiy a (linear mixed) model for each of them using the \code{nonlinear}
#'   argument. Let's say we just want to estimate those three parameters
#'   with no further covariates or random effects. Then we can write
#'   \code{nonlinear = alpha + beta + lambda ~ 1} or equivalently
#'   (and more flexible) \code{nonlinear = list(alpha ~ 1, beta ~ 1, lambda ~ 1)}. 
#'   This can, of course, be extended. If we have another predictor \code{z} and 
#'   observations nested within the grouping factor \code{g}, we may write for 
#'   instance \cr \code{nonlinear = list(alpha ~ 1, beta ~ 1 + z + (1|g), lambda ~ 1)}.
#'   The formula syntax described above applies here as well.
#'   In this example, we are using \code{z} and \code{g} only for the 
#'   prediction of \code{beta}, but we might also use them for the other
#'   non-linear parameters (provided that the resulting model is still 
#'   scientifically reasonable). 
#'   
#'   Non-linear models may not be uniquely identified and / or show bad convergence.
#'   For this reason it is mandatory to specify priors on the non-linear parameters.
#'   For instructions on how to do that, see \code{\link[brms:set_prior]{set_prior}}.
#'   
#'   \bold{Families and link functions}
#'   
#'   Family \code{gaussian} with \code{identity} link leads to linear regression. 
#'   Families \code{student}, and \code{cauchy} with \code{identity} link leads to 
#'   robust linear regression that is less influenced by outliers. 
#'   Families \code{poisson}, \code{negbinomial}, and \code{geometric} 
#'   with \code{log} link lead to regression models for count data. 
#'   Families \code{binomial} and \code{bernoulli} with \code{logit} link leads to 
#'   logistic regression and family \code{categorical} to multi-logistic regression 
#'   when there are more than two possible outcomes.
#'   Families \code{cumulative}, \code{cratio} ('contiuation ratio'), 
#'   \code{sratio} ('stopping ratio'), and \code{acat} ('adjacent category') 
#'   leads to ordinal regression. Families \code{Gamma}, \code{weibull}, 
#'   \code{exponential}, and \code{inverse.gaussian} can be used (among others) 
#'   for survival regression when combined with the \code{log} link. 
#'   Families \code{hurdle_poisson}, \code{hurdle_negbinomial}, \code{hurdle_gamma}, 
#'   \code{zero_inflated_poisson}, and \cr
#'   \code{zero_inflated_negbinomial} combined with the 
#'   \code{log} link, and  \code{zero_inflated_binomial} with the \code{logit} link, 
#'   allow to estimate zero-inflated and hurdle models. These models 
#'   can be very helpful when there are many zeros in the data that cannot be explained 
#'   by the primary distribution of the response. Family \code{hurdle_gamma} is 
#'   especially useful, as a traditional \code{Gamma} model cannot be reasonably 
#'   fitted for data containing zeros in the response. 
#'   
#'   In the following, we list all possible links for each family.
#'   The families \code{gaussian}, \code{student}, and \code{cauchy} 
#'   accept the links (as names) \code{identity}, \code{log}, and \code{inverse};
#'   families \code{poisson}, \code{negbinomial}, and \code{geometric} the links 
#'   \code{log}, \code{identity}, and \code{sqrt}; 
#'   families \code{binomial}, \code{bernoulli}, \code{Beta},
#'   \code{cumulative}, \code{cratio}, \code{sratio}, and \code{acat} 
#'   the links \code{logit}, \code{probit}, \code{probit_approx}, 
#'   \code{cloglog}, and \code{cauchit}; 
#'   family \code{categorical} the link \code{logit}; 
#'   families \code{Gamma}, \code{weibull}, and \code{exponential} 
#'   the links \code{log}, \code{identity}, and \code{inverse};
#'   family \code{inverse.gaussian} the links \code{1/mu^2}, 
#'   \code{inverse}, \code{identity} and \code{log}; 
#'   families \code{hurdle_poisson}, \code{hurdle_negbinomial},
#'   \code{hurdle_gamma}, \code{zero_inflated_poisson}, and
#'   \code{zero_inflated_negbinomial} the link \code{log}. 
#'   The first link mentioned for each family is the default.     
#'   
#'   Please note that when calling the \code{\link[stats:family]{Gamma}} 
#'   family function, the default link will be \code{inverse} not \code{log}. 
#'   Also, the \code{probit_approx} link cannot be used when calling the
#'   \code{\link[stats:family]{binomial}} family function. 
#'   
#'   The current implementation of \code{inverse.gaussian} models has some 
#'   convergence problems and requires carefully chosen prior distributions 
#'   to work efficiently. For this reason, we currently do not recommend
#'   to use the \code{inverse.gaussian} family, unless you really feel
#'   that your data requires exactly this type of model. \cr
#'   
#'   \bold{Prior distributions}
#'   
#'   As of \pkg{brms} 0.5.0, priors should be specified using the 
#'   \code{\link[brms:set_prior]{set_prior}} function. 
#'   Its documentation contains detailed information 
#'   on how to correctly specify priors. To find out on 
#'   which parameters or parameter classes priors can be defined, 
#'   use \code{\link[brms:get_prior]{get_prior}}. \cr
#'   
#'   \bold{Adjusting the sampling behavior of \pkg{Stan}}
#'   
#'   In addition to choosing the number of iterations, warmup samples, 
#'   and chains, users can control the behavior of the NUTS sampler, 
#'   by using the \code{control} argument.
#'   The most important reason to use \code{control} is to decrease 
#'   (or eliminate at best) the number of divergent transitions
#'   that cause a bias in the obtained posterior samples. 
#'   Whenever you see the warning
#'   "There were x divergent transitions after warmup." 
#'   you should really think about increasing \code{adapt_delta}.
#'   To do this, write \code{control = list(adapt_delta = <x>)}, 
#'   where \code{<x>} should usually be value between \code{0.8} 
#'   (current default) and \code{1}. Increasing \code{adapt_delta} 
#'   will slow down the sampler but will decrease the number of 
#'   divergent transitions threatening the validity of your 
#'   posterior samples.
#'   
#'   Another problem arises when the depth of the tree being evaluated 
#'   in each iteration is exceeded. This is less common than having 
#'   divergent transitions, but may also bias the posterior samples.
#'   When it happens, \pkg{Stan} will throw out a warning suggesting 
#'   to increase \code{max_treedepth}, which can be accomplished by 
#'   writing \code{control = list(max_treedepth = <x>)} with a positive 
#'   integer \code{<x>} that should usually be larger than the current 
#'   default of \code{10}. For more details on the \code{control} argument 
#'   see \code{\link[rstan:stan]{stan}}.
