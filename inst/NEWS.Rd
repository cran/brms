      \code{inverse.gaussian}
      \item allow to specify truncation boundaries of the response variable
      \item add support for autoregressive (AR) effects of residuals, which can
      be modeled using the \code{cor_ar} and \code{cor_arma} functions
      \item stationary autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) effects 
      of order one can now also be fitted using special covariance matrices
      \item implement multivariate student-t models

      using the \code{stanplot} method
      \item implement horseshoe priors to model sparsity in 
      fixed effects coefficients
      \item automatically scale default standard deviation priors so that
      they remain only weakly informative independent on the response scale
      \item report model weights computed by the \pkg{loo} package when comparing
      multiple fitted models 
    }
  }
  \subsection{OTHER CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item separate the fixed effects Intercept from other fixed effects
      in the \pkg{Stan} code to slightly improve sampling efficiency
      \item move autoregressive (AR) effects of the response from the \code{cor_ar}

      \code{fitted} and \code{predict} method
