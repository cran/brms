The purpose of this vignette is to discuss the parameterizations of the families (i.e., response distributions) used in **brms**. For a more general overview of the package see `vignette("brms")`.

## Notation

Throughout this vignette, we use $y$ to refer to the response variable and $\eta$ to refer to the (non-)linear predictor (see `help(brmsformula)` for details on supported predictor terms). We write $y_i$ and $\eta_i$ for the response and linear predictor of observation $i$. Furthermore, we use $f$ for a density function and $g$ for an inverse link function.

## Location shift models

The density of the **gaussian** family is given by
$$f(y_i) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y_i - g(\eta_i)}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)$$ 
where $\sigma$ is the residual standard deviation. The density of the **student** family is given by
$$f(y_i) = \frac{\Gamma((\nu + 1)/2)}{\Gamma(\nu/2)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\nu\pi}\sigma}
\left(1 + \frac{1}{\nu} \left(\frac{y_i - g(\eta_i)}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)^{-(\nu+1)/2}$$
$\Gamma$ denotes the gamma function and $\nu$ are the degrees of freedom. As $\nu \rightarrow \infty$, the student distribution becomes the gaussian distribution. For location shift models, $y_i$ can be any real value.

## Binary and count data models

The density of the **binomial** family is given by
$$f(y_i) = {N_i \choose y_i} g(\eta_i)^{y_i} (1-g(\eta_i))^{N_i - y_i}$$
where $N_i$ is the number of trials and $y_i \in \{0, ... , N_i\}$. When all $N_i$ are $1$ (i.e., $y_i \in \{0,1\}$), the bernoulli distribution for binary data arises. **binomial** and **bernoulli** families are distinguished in **brms** as the bernoulli distribution has its own implementation in **Stan** that is computationlly more efficient. 

For $y_i \in \mathbb{N}_0$, the density of the **poisson** family is given by
$$f(y_i) = \frac{g(\eta_i)^{y_i}}{y_i!} exp(-g(\eta_i))$$
The density of the **negative binomial** family is
$$f(y_i) = {y_i + \phi - 1 \choose y_i} \left(\frac{g(\eta_i)}{g(\eta_i) + \phi}\right)^{y_i}
\left(\frac{\phi}{g(\eta_i) + \phi}\right)^\phi$$
where $\phi$ is a positive precision parameter. For $\phi \rightarrow \infty$, the negative binomial distribution becomes the poisson distribution. The density of the **geometric** family arises if $\phi$ is set to $1$.

## Survival models

With survival models we mean all models that are defined on the positive reals only, that is $y_i \in \mathbb{R}^+$. The density of the **lognormal** family is given by 
$$f(y_i) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma x} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\log(y_i) - g(\eta_i)}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)$$ 
where $\sigma$ is the residual standard deviation on the log-scale.
The density of the **Gamma** family is given by
$$f(y_i) = \frac{(\alpha / g(\eta_i))^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} y_i^{\alpha-1} 
\exp\left(-\frac{\alpha y_i}{g(\eta_i)}\right)$$
where $\alpha$ is a positive shape parameter. The density of the **weibull** family is given by
$$f(y_i) = \frac{\alpha}{g(\eta_i / \alpha)} \left(\frac{y_i}{g(\eta_i / \alpha)}\right)^{\alpha-1} 
\exp\left(-\left(\frac{y_i}{g(\eta_i / \alpha)}\right)^\alpha\right)$$
where $\alpha$ is again a positive shape parameter. The **exponential** family arises if $\alpha$ is set to $1$ for either the gamma or weibull distribution.

## Beta models

The density of the **Beta** family for $y_i \in (0,1)$ is given by
$$f(y_i) = \frac{y_i^{g(\eta_i) \phi - 1} (1-y_i)^{(1-g(\eta_i)) \phi)-1}}{B(g(\eta_i) \phi, (1-g(\eta_i)) \phi)}$$
where $B$ is the beta function and $\phi$ is a positive precision parameter.

## Circular models

The density of the **von_mises** family for $y_i \in (-\pi,\pi)$ is given by
$$f(y_i) = \frac{\exp(\kappa \cos(y_i - g(\eta_i)))}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)}$$
where $I_0$ is the modified Bessel function of order 0 and $\kappa$ is
a positive precision parameter.

## Ordinal and categorical models

For ordinal and categorical models, $y_i$ is one of the categories $1, ..., K$. The intercepts of ordinal models are called thresholds and are denoted as $\tau_k$, with $k \in \{1, ..., K-1\}$, whereas $\eta$ does not contain a fixed effects intercept. Note that the applied link functions $h$ are technically distribution functions $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0,1]$.
The density of the **cumulative** family (implementing the most basic ordinal model) is given by
$$f(y_i) = g(\tau_{y_i + 1} - \eta_i) - g(\tau_{y_i} - \eta_i)$$ 
The densities of the **sratio** (stopping ratio) and **cratio** (continuation ratio) families are given by
$$f(y_i) =  g(\tau_{y_i + 1} - \eta_i) \prod_{k = 1}^{y_i} (1 - g(\tau_{k} - \eta_i))$$
and 
$$f(y_i) = (1 - g(\eta_i - \tau_{y_i + 1})) \prod_{k = 1}^{y_i} g(\eta_i - \tau_{k})$$
respectively. Note that both families are equivalent for symmetric link functions such as logit or probit. The density of the **acat** (adjacent category) family is given by
$$f(y_i) = \frac{\prod_{k=1}^{y_i} g(\eta_i - \tau_{k})
  \prod_{k=y_i+1}^K(1-g(\eta_i - \tau_{k}))}{\sum_{k=0}^K\prod_{j=1}^k g(\eta_i-\tau_{j})
  \prod_{j=k+1}^K(1-g(\eta_i - \tau_{j}))}$$
For the logit link, this can be simplified to
$$f(y_i) = \frac{\exp \left(\sum_{k=1}^{y_i} (\eta_i - \tau_{k}) \right)}
  {\sum_{k=0}^K \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^k (\eta_i - \tau_{j}) \right)}$$
The linear predictor $\eta$ can be generalized to also depend on the category $k$ for a subset of predictors. This leads to so called category specific effects (for details on how to specify them see `help(brm)`). Note that **cumulative** and **sratio** models use $\tau - \eta$, whereas **cratio** and **acat** use $\eta - \tau$. This is done to ensure that larger values of $\eta$ increase the probability of *higher* reponse categories.

The **categorical** family is currently only implemented with the logit link function and has density
$$f(y_i) = \frac{\exp(\eta_{iy_i})}{\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \exp(\eta_{ik})}$$
Note that $\eta$ does also depend on the category $k$. For reasons of identifiability, $\eta_{i1}$ is set to $0$.

## Zero-inflated and hurdle models

**Zero-inflated** and **hurdle** families extend existing families by adding special processes for responses that are zero. The densitiy of a **zero-inflated** family is given by
$$f_z(y_i) = g_z(\eta_{zi}) + (1 - g_z(\eta_{zi})) f(y_i) \quad \text{if } y_i = 0 \\
  f_z(y_i) = (1 - g_z(\eta_{zi}) f(y_i) \quad \text{if } y_i > 0$$
The zero-inflation part has its own linear predictor $\eta_{zi}$ combined with the logit link $g_z$. Currently implemented families are **zero_inflated_poisson**, **zero_inflated_binomial**, **zero_inflated_negbinomial**, and **zero_inflated_beta**.
The density of a **hurdle** family is given by 
$$f_z(y_i) = g_z(\eta_{zi}) \quad \text{if } y_i = 0 \\
  f_z(y_i) = (1 - g_z(\eta_{zi})) f(y_i) / (1 - f(0)) \quad \text{if } y_i > 0$$
Currently implemented families are **hurdle_poisson**, **hurdle_negbinomial**, **hurdle_gamma**, and **hurdle_lognormal**. Both linear predictors (i.e., $\eta$ and $\eta_z$) can be specified within the `formula` argument. See `help(brmsformula)` for instructions on how to do that.
