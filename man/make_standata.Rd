\title{Data for \pkg{brms} Models}
\usage{
make_standata(formula, data = NULL, family = "gaussian", autocor = NULL,
  partial = NULL, cov.ranef = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class): 
a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. 
The details of model specification are given under 'Details'.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame, list or environment  (or object coercible by 
\code{as.data.frame} to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, 
the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}, 
typically the environment from which \code{brm} is called. 
Although it is optional, we strongly recommend to supply a data.frame.}

\item{family}{A description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. 
This can be a family function, a call to a family function or a character string naming the family.
Currently, the following families are supported:
\code{gaussian}, \code{student}, \code{cauchy}, \code{binomial}, \code{bernoulli}, 
\code{categorical}, \code{poisson}, \code{negbinomial}, \code{geometric},
\code{gamma}, \code{inverse.gaussian}, \code{exponential}, \code{weibull},
\code{cumulative}, \code{cratio}, \code{sratio}, \code{acat},
\code{hurdle_poisson}, \code{hurdle_negbinomial}, \code{hurdle_gamma}, 
\code{zero_inflated_poisson}, and \code{zero_inflated_negbinomial}.
Every family function has a \code{link} argument allowing to specify
the link function to be applied on the response variable.
If not specified, default links are used.
See \code{\link[stats:family]{family}} for help on standard family functions 
and \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brmsfamily}} for family functions
specific to the \pkg{brms} package. 
For backwards compatibility, \code{family} may also be a vector of two
character strings, the first naming the family and the second naming the link.
Further information is provided under 'Details'.}

\item{autocor}{An optional \code{\link{cor_brms}} object describing the correlation structure 
within the response variable (i.e. the 'autocorrelation'). 
See the documentation of \code{\link{cor_brms}} for a description 
of the available correlation structures. Defaults to NULL, corresponding to no correlations.}

\item{partial}{A one sided formula of the form \code{~expression} specifying the predictors with 
category specific effects in non-cumulative ordinal models
(i.e. in families \code{cratio}, \code{sratio}, or \code{acat}).}

\item{cov.ranef}{A list of matrices that are proportional to the (within) covariance structure of the random effects. 
The names of the matrices should correspond to columns in \code{data} that are used as grouping factors. 
All levels of the grouping factor should appear as rownames of the corresponding matrix.}

\item{...}{Other arguments for internal usage only}
}
\value{
A named list of objects containing the required data 
  to fit a \pkg{brms} model with \pkg{Stan}.
}
\description{
Generate data for \pkg{brms} models to be passed to \pkg{Stan}
}
\examples{
data1 <- make_standata(rating ~ treat + period + carry + (1|subject), 
                       data = inhaler, family = "cumulative")
names(data1)

data2 <- make_standata(count ~ log_Age_c + log_Base4_c * Trt_c 
                       + (1|patient) + (1|visit), 
                       data = epilepsy, family = "poisson")
names(data2)
