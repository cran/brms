\description{
Ezzet and Whitehead (1991) analyse data from a two-treatment, two-period crossover trial to compare 2 inhalation devices for
  delivering the drug salbutamol in 286 asthma patients. Patients were asked to rate the clarity of leaflet instructions accompanying each device,
  using a 4-point ordinal scale.
