\title{Epileptic seizure counts}
\format{A dataframe of 236 observations containing information 
  on the following 9 variables. 
\describe{
 \item{Age}{The age of the patients in years}
 \item{Base}{The seizure count at 8-weeks baseline}
 \item{Trt}{Either \code{0} or \code{1} indicating 
   if the patient received anti-convulsant therapy} 
 \item{log_Age_c}{The logarithm of Age centered around its mean}
 \item{log_Base4_c}{The logarithm of Base divided by 4 
   (i.e. log(Base/4)) centered around its mean}
 \item{Trt_c}{Trt centered around its mean}
 \item{visit}{The session number from \code{1} (first visit) 
   to \code{4} (last visit)}
 \item{count}{The seizure count between two visits}
 \item{patient}{The patient number}
 \item{obs}{The observation number, 
   i.e. a unique identifier for each observation}

\description{
Breslow and Clayton (1993) analyze data initially 
  provided by Thall and Vail (1990) concerning 
  seizure counts in a randomized trial of anti-convulsant 
  therapy in epilepsy. Covariates are treatment, 
  8-week baseline seizure counts, and age of the patients in years.
