\title{Epileptic seizure counts}
\format{A dataframe of 236 observations containing information on the following 9 variables.
\describe{
 \item{Age}{The age of the patients in years}
 \item{Base}{The seizure count at 8-weeks baseline}
 \item{Trt}{Either \code{0} or \code{1} indicating if the patient recieved anti-convulsant therapy}
 \item{log_Age_c}{The logarithm of Age centered arounds its mean}
 \item{log_Base4_c}{The logarithm of Base divided by 4 (i.e. log(Base/4)) centered around its mean}
 \item{Trt_c}{Trt centered around its mean}
 \item{visit}{The session number from \code{1} (first visit) to \code{4} (last visit)}
 \item{count}{The seizure count between two visits}
 \item{patient}{The patient number}
}}

\description{
Breslow and Clayton (1993) analyse data initially provided by Thall and Vail (1990) concerning
  seizure counts in a randomised trial of anti-convulsant therapy in epilepsy. Covariates are treatment,
  8-week baseline seizure counts, and age of the patients in years.
