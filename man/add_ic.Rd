\title{Add information criteria and fit indices to fitted model objects}
\usage{
add_ic(x, ...)

\method{add_ic}{brmsfit}(x, ic = "loo", model_name = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE, file = NULL, force_save = FALSE, ...)

add_ic(x, ...) <- value

add_loo(x, ...)

add_waic(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \R object typically of class \code{brmsfit}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the underlying 
functions computing the information criteria or fit indices.}

\item{ic, value}{Names of the information criteria / fit indices 
to compute. Currently supported are \code{"loo"}, 
\code{"waic"}, \code{"kfold"}, \code{"R2"} (R-squared), and 
\code{"marglik"} (log marginal likelihood).}

\item{model_name}{Optional name of the model. If \code{NULL}
(the default) the name is taken from the call to \code{x}.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical; Indicates if already stored fit 
indices should be overwritten. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{file}{Either \code{NULL} or a character string. In the latter case, the
fitted model object including the newly added criterion values is saved via
\code{\link{saveRDS}} in a file named after the string supplied in
\code{file}. The \code{.rds} extension is added automatically. If \code{x}
was already stored in a file before, the file name will be reused
automatically (with a message) unless overwritten by \code{file}. In any
case, \code{file} only applies if new criteria were actually added via
\code{add_ic} or if \code{force_save} was set to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{force_save}{Logical; only relevant if \code{file} is specified and
ignored otherwise. If \code{TRUE}, the fitted model object will be saved
regardless of whether new criteria were added via \code{add_ic}.}
}
\value{
An object of the same class as \code{x}, but
  with information criteria added for later usage.
}
\description{
Add information criteria and fit indices to fitted model objects
}
\details{
The methods \code{add_loo} and add \code{add_waic}
  are just convenient wrappers around \code{add_ic}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
fit <- brm(count ~ Trt, epilepsy, poisson())
# add both LOO and WAIC at once
fit <- add_ic(fit, ic = c("loo", "waic"))
print(fit$loo)
print(fit$waic)
}
