\title{Model Predictions of \code{brmsfit} Objects}
\usage{
\method{predict}{brmsfit}(object, newdata = NULL, re_formula = NULL,
  transform = NULL, allow_new_levels = FALSE, summary = TRUE,
  probs = c(0.025, 0.975), ntrys = 5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{brmsfit}}

\item{newdata}{An optional data.frame containing new data to make predictions for.
If \code{NULL} (default), the data used to fit the model is applied.}

\item{re_formula}{formula containing random effects to be considered in the prediction. 
If \code{NULL} (default), include all random effects; if \code{NA}, include no random effects.
Other options will be implemented in the future.}

\item{transform}{A function or a character string naming a function to be applied on the predicted responses
before summary statistics are computed.}

\item{allow_new_levels}{Currenly, \code{FALSE} (no new levels allowed) is the only option. 
This will change in future versions of the package.}

\item{summary}{logical. Should summary statistics (i.e. means, sds, and 95\% intervals) be returned
instead of the raw values. Default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{probs}{The percentiles to be computed by the \code{quantile} function. 
Only used if \code{summary} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{ntrys}{Parameter used in rejection sampling for truncated discrete models only 
(defaults to \code{5}). See Details for more information.}

\item{...}{Currently ignored}
}
\value{
Predicted values of the response variable. If \code{summary = TRUE} the output depends on the family:
  For catagorical and ordinal families, it is a N x C matrix where N is the number of observations and
  C is the number of categories. For all other families, it is a N x E matrix where E is equal 
  to \code{length(probs) + 2}.
  If \code{summary = FALSE}, the output is as a S x N matrix, where S is the number of samples.
}
\description{
Make predictions based on the fitted model parameters. 
Can be performed for the data used to fit the model (posterior predictive checks) or for new data.
}
\details{
For truncated discrete models only:
  In the absence of any general algorithm to sample from truncated discrete distributions,
  rejection sampling is applied in this special case. This means that values are sampled until 
  a value lies within the defined truncation boundaries. In practice, this procedure may be 
  rather slow (especially in R). Thus, we try to do approximate rejection sampling 
  by sampling each value \code{ntrys} times and then select a valid value. 
  If all values are invalid, the closest boundary is used, instead. 
  If there are more than a few of these pathological cases, 
  a warning will occure suggesting to increase argument \code{ntrys}.
  
  For models fitted with \pkg{brms} <= 0.5.0 only: 
  Be careful when using \code{newdata} with factors in fixed or random effects. 
  The predicted results are only valid if all factor levels present in the initial 
  data are also defined and ordered correctly for the factors in \code{newdata}.
  Grouping factors may contain fewer levels than in the inital data without causing problems.
  When using higher versions of \pkg{brms}, all factors are automatically checked 
  for correctness and amended if necessary.

\dontrun{
## fit a model
fit <- brm(time | cens(censored) ~ age + sex, data = kidney,
           family = "exponential", silent = TRUE)

## posterior predictive checks
pp <- predict(fit)
head(pp)

## predict response for new data
newdata <- data.frame(sex = factor(c("male", "female")),
                      age = c(20,50))
predict(fit, newdata = newdata)
