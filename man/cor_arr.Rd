\title{ARR(r) correlation structure}
\usage{
cor_arr(formula = ~1, r = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A one sided formula of the form \code{~ t}, or \code{~ t | g}, 
specifying a time covariate \code{t} and, optionally, a grouping factor \code{g}. 
A covariate for this correlation structure must be integer valued. 
When a grouping factor is present in \code{formula}, the correlation structure 
is assumed to apply only to observations within the same grouping level; 
observations with different grouping levels are assumed to be uncorrelated. 
Defaults to \code{~ 1}, which corresponds to using the order of the observations 
in the data as a covariate, and no groups.}

\item{r}{A non-negative integer specifying the autoregressive
response (ARR) order of the ARMA structure. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{cor_arma} containing solely
  autoregressive response terms.
}
\description{
This function is a constructor for the \code{cor_arma} class 
allowing for autoregressive effects of the response only.
}
\details{
AR refers to autoregressive effects of residuals, which
  is what is typically understood as autoregressive effects.
  However, one may also model autoregressive effects of the response
  variable, which is called ARR in \pkg{brms}.
