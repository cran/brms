\title{ARR(r) correlation structure}
\usage{
cor_arr(formula = ~1, r = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A one sided formula of the form ~ t, or ~ t | g, 
specifying a time covariate t and, optionally, a grouping factor g. 
A covariate for this correlation structure must be integer valued. 
When a grouping factor is present in \code{formula}, the correlation structure 
is assumed to apply only to observations within the same grouping level; 
observations with different grouping levels are assumed to be uncorrelated. 
Defaults to ~ 1, which corresponds to using the order of the observations 
in the data as a covariate, and no groups.}

\item{r}{A non-negative integer specifying the autoregressive response (ARR) order. 
See 'Details' for differences of AR and ARR effects. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{cor_arma} containing solely
  autoregressive response terms.
}
\description{
This function is a constructor for the \code{cor_arma} class 
allowing for autoregressive effects of the response only.
}
\details{
In most packages, AR effects refer to autocorrelation of residuals.
  \pkg{brms} also implements autocorrelation of the response, which can be specified 
  using argument \code{r} in the \code{cor_arma} and \code{cor_arr} functions.
