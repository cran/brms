}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class 
\code{\link[brms:brmsformula]{brmsformula}}
(or one that can be coerced to that class): 
a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. 
The details of model specification are explained in 
\code{\link[brms:brmsformula]{brmsformula}}.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame, list or environment  (or object coercible by 
\code{as.data.frame} to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. 
If not found in data, the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}, 
typically the environment from which \code{brm} is called. 
Although it is optional, we strongly recommend to supply a data.frame.}

\item{family}{A description of the response distribution and link function 
to be used in the model. This can be a family function, 
a call to a family function or a character string naming the family.
Every family function has a \code{link} argument allowing to specify
the link function to be applied on the response variable.
If not specified, default links are used.
For details of supported families see 
\code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brmsfamily}}.}

\item{prior}{One or more \code{brmsprior} objects created by function 
\code{\link[brms:set_prior]{set_prior}} and combined using the \code{c} method. 
A single \code{brmsprior} object may be passed without \code{c()} surrounding it. 
See also  \code{\link[brms:get_prior]{get_prior}} for more help.}

\item{autocor}{An optional \code{\link{cor_brms}} object describing 
the correlation structure 
within the response variable (i.e. the 'autocorrelation'). 
See the documentation of \code{\link{cor_brms}} for a description 
of the available correlation structures. Defaults to NULL, 
corresponding to no correlations.}

\item{nonlinear}{An optional list of formuluas, specifying 
linear models for non-linear parameters. If \code{NULL} (the default)
\code{formula} is treated as an ordinary formula. 
If not \code{NULL}, \code{formula} is treated as a non-linear model
and \code{nonlinear} should contain a formula for each non-linear 
parameter, which has the parameter on the left hand side and its
linear predictor on the right hand side.
Alternatively, it can be a single formula with all non-linear
parameters on the left hand side (separated by a \code{+}) and a
common linear predictor on the right hand side.
More information is given under 'Details'.}

\item{partial}{(Deprecated) A one sided formula of the form 
\code{~expression} allowing to specify predictors with 
category specific effects in non-cumulative ordinal models 
(i.e. in families \code{cratio}, \code{sratio}, or \code{acat}).
As of \pkg{brms} > 0.8.0 category specific effects should be 
specified directly within \code{formula} using function \code{cse}.}

\item{threshold}{A character string indicating the type of thresholds 
(i.e. intercepts) used in an ordinal model. 
\code{"flexible"} provides the standard unstructured thresholds and 
\code{"equidistant"} restricts the distance between 
consecutive thresholds to the same value.}

\item{cov_ranef}{A list of matrices that are proportional to the 
(within) covariance structure of the random effects. 
The names of the matrices should correspond to columns 
in \code{data} that are used as grouping factors. 
All levels of the grouping factor should appear as rownames 
of the corresponding matrix. This argument can be used,
among others, to model pedigrees and phylogenetic effects.}

\item{ranef}{A flag to indicate if random effects 
for each level of the grouping factor(s) 
should be saved (default is \code{TRUE}). 
Set to \code{FALSE} to save memory. 
The argument has no impact on the model fitting itself.}

\item{sparse}{Logical; indicates whether the population-level 
design matrix should be treated as sparse (defaults to \code{FALSE}). 
For design matrices with many zeros, this can considerably 
reduce required memory. For univariate sparse models, it may be
sensible to prevent the design matrix from being centered
(see 'Details' for more information), as centering may
reduce sparsity. 
For all models using multivariate syntax 
(i.e. multivariate linear models, zero-inflated and hurdle models 
as well as categorical models), setting \code{sparse = TRUE}, 
is generally worth a try to decrease memory requirements.
However, sampling speed is currently not improved or even
slightly decreased.}

\item{sample_prior}{A flag to indicate if samples from all specified 
proper priors should be drawn additionally to the posterior samples
(defaults to \code{FALSE}). Among others, these samples can be used 
to calculate Bayes factors for point hypotheses. 
Alternatively, \code{sample_prior} can be set to \code{"only"} to
sample solely from the priors. In this case, all parameters must 
have proper priors.}

\item{knots}{Optional list containing user specified knot values to be 
used for basis construction of smoothing terms. For details see
\code{\link[mgcv:gamm]{gamm}}.}

\item{stan_funs}{An optional character string containing self-defined 
\pkg{Stan} functions, which will be included in the functions block 
of the generated \pkg{Stan} code.}

\item{fit}{An instance of S3 class \code{brmsfit} derived from a previous fit; 
defaults to \code{NA}. 
If \code{fit} is of class \code{brmsfit}, the compiled model associated 
with the fitted result is re-used and all arguments 
modifying the model code or data are ignored.}

\item{inits}{Either \code{"random"} or \code{"0"}. 
If inits is \code{"random"} (the default), 
Stan will randomly generate initial values for parameters. 
If it is \code{"0"}, all parameters are initiliazed to zero. 
This option is recommended for \code{exponential} and \code{weibull} models, 
as it happens that default (\code{"random"}) inits cause samples 
to be essentially constant. 
Generally, setting \code{inits = "0"} is worth a try, 
if chains do not behave well.
Alternatively, \code{inits} can be a list of lists containing 
the initial values, or a function (or function name) generating initial values. 
The latter options are mainly implemented for internal testing.}

\item{chains}{Number of Markov chains (defaults to 4). 
A deprecated alias is \code{n.chains}.}

\item{iter}{Number of total iterations per chain (including warmup; defaults to 2000).
A deprecated alias is \code{n.iter}.}

\item{warmup}{A positive integer specifying number of warmup (aka burnin) iterations. 
This also specifies the number of iterations used for stepsize adaptation, 
so warmup samples should not be used for inference. The number of warmup should not 
be larger than \code{iter} and the default is \code{iter/2}.
A deprecated alias is \code{n.warmup}.}

\item{thin}{Thinning rate. Must be a positive integer. 
Set \code{thin > 1} to save memory and computation time if \code{iter} is large. 
Default is 1, that is no thinning. A deprecated alias is \code{n.thin}.}

\item{cluster}{Number of clusters to use to run parallel chains. Default is 1.
A deprecated alias is \code{n.cluster}. To use the built-in parallel execution
of \pkg{rstan}, specify argument \code{cores} instead of \code{cluster}.}

\item{cluster_type}{A character string specifying the type of cluster created by 
\code{\link[parallel:makeCluster]{makeCluster}} when sampling in parallel 
(i.e. when \code{cluster} is greater \code{1}). 
Default is \code{"PSOCK"} working on all platforms. 
For OS X and Linux, \code{"FORK"} may be a faster and more stable option, 
but it does not work on Windows.}

\item{control}{A named \code{list} of parameters to control the sampler's behavior. 
It defaults to \code{NULL} so all the default values are used. 
The most important control parameters are discussed in the 'Details'
section below. For a comprehensive overview see \code{\link[rstan:stan]{stan}}.}

\item{algorithm}{Character string indicating the estimation approach to use. 
Can be \code{"sampling"} for MCMC (the default), \code{"meanfield"} for
variational inference with independent normal distributions, or
\code{"fullrank"} for variational inference with a multivariate normal
distribution.}

\item{silent}{logical; If \code{TRUE}, warning messages of the sampler are suppressed.}

\item{seed}{Positive integer. Used by \code{set.seed} to make results reproducable.}

\item{save_model}{Either \code{NULL} or a character string. 
In the latter case, the model code is
saved in a file named after the string supplied in \code{save_model}, 
which may also contain the full path where to save the file.
If only a name is given, the file is saved in the current working directory.}

\item{save_dso}{Logical, defaulting to \code{TRUE}, indicating whether 
the dynamic shared object (DSO) compiled from the C++ code for the model 
will be saved or not. If \code{TRUE}, we can draw samples from the same 
model in another \R session using the saved DSO 
(i.e., without compiling the C++ code again).}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to Stan.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{brmsfit}, which contains the posterior samples along 
  with many other useful information about the model.

\description{
Fit a Bayesian generalized (non-)linear Multilevel model using Stan
}
\details{
Fit a generalized (non-)linear multilevel model, 
  which incorporates both population-level parameters 
  (also known as fixed-effects) and group-level parameters
  (also known as random effects) in a (non-)linear predictor 
  via full Bayesian inference using Stan. 
  
  \bold{Formula syntax of brms models}
  
  The details of the formula syntax applied in \pkg{brms} 
  can be found in \code{\link[brms:brmsformula]{brmsformula}}.
  
  \bold{Families and link functions}
  
  Details of families supported by \pkg{brms} 
  can be found in \code{\link[brms:brmsfamily]{brmsfamily}}.
  
  \bold{Prior distributions}
  
  Priors should be specified using the 
  \code{\link[brms:set_prior]{set_prior}} function. 
  Its documentation contains detailed information 
  on how to correctly specify priors. To find out on 
  which parameters or parameter classes priors can be defined, 
  use \code{\link[brms:get_prior]{get_prior}}. \cr
  
  \bold{Adjusting the sampling behavior of \pkg{Stan}}
  
  In addition to choosing the number of iterations, warmup samples, 
  and chains, users can control the behavior of the NUTS sampler, 
  by using the \code{control} argument.
  The most important reason to use \code{control} is to decrease 
  (or eliminate at best) the number of divergent transitions
  that cause a bias in the obtained posterior samples. 
  Whenever you see the warning
  "There were x divergent transitions after warmup." 
  you should really think about increasing \code{adapt_delta}.
  To do this, write \code{control = list(adapt_delta = <x>)}, 
  where \code{<x>} should usually be value between \code{0.8} 
  (current default) and \code{1}. Increasing \code{adapt_delta} 
  will slow down the sampler but will decrease the number of 
  divergent transitions threatening the validity of your 
  posterior samples.
  
  Another problem arises when the depth of the tree being evaluated 
  in each iteration is exceeded. This is less common than having 
  divergent transitions, but may also bias the posterior samples.
  When it happens, \pkg{Stan} will throw out a warning suggesting 
  to increase \code{max_treedepth}, which can be accomplished by 
  writing \code{control = list(max_treedepth = <x>)} with a positive 
  integer \code{<x>} that should usually be larger than the current 
  default of \code{10}. For more details on the \code{control} argument 
  see \code{\link[rstan:stan]{stan}}.
