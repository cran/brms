\title{Compute LOO}
\usage{
\method{LOO}{brmsfit}(x, ..., compare = TRUE, cores = getOption("loo.cores",
  parallel::detectCores()), wcp = 0.2, wtrunc = 3/4)

LOO(x, ..., compare = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model object typically of class \code{brmsfit}.}

\item{...}{Optionally more fitted model objects.}

\item{compare}{A flag indicating if the WAICs of the models should be compared to each other.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallelization. 
This can be set for an entire R session by \code{options(loo.cores = NUMBER)}. 
The default is \code{\link[parallel:detectCores]{detectCores()}}.}

\item{wcp, wtrunc}{Parameters used for the Pareto smoothed importance sampling. 
See \code{\link[loo:loo]{loo}} for details.}
}
\value{
If just one object is provided, an object of class \code{ic}. 
If multiple objects are provided, an object of class \code{iclist}.
}
\description{
Compute Leave-one-out cross-validation based on the posterior likelihood
by using the \pkg{loo} package
}
\details{
When comparing models fitted to the same data, the smaller the LOO, the better the fit.
