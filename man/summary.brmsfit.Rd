\title{Create a summary of a fitted model represented by a \code{brmsfit} object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{brmsfit}(object, priors = FALSE, prob = 0.95, mc_se = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{brmsfit}}

\item{priors}{Logical; Indicating if priors should be included 
in the summary. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{prob}{A value between 0 and 1 indicating the desired probability 
to be covered by the uncertainty intervals. The default is 0.95.}

\item{mc_se}{Logical; Indicating if the uncertainty caused by the 
MCMC sampling should be shown in the summary. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Other potential arguments}
}

\details{
The convergence diagnostics \code{Rhat}, \code{Bulk_ESS}, and 
\code{Tail_ESS} are described in detail in Vehtari et al. (2019).
