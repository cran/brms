\description{
Define priors for specific parameters or classes of parameters
}
\details{
\code{set_prior} is used to define prior distributions for parameters 
  in \pkg{brms} models. Below, we explain its usage and list some common 
  prior distributions for parameters. 
  A complete overview on possible prior distributions is given 
  in the Stan Reference Manual available at \url{http://mc-stan.org/}.
  
  To combine multiple priors, use \code{c(...)}, 
  e.g., \code{c(set_prior(...), set_prior(...))}.
  \pkg{brms} performs no checks if the priors are written in 
  correct Stan language. Instead, Stan will check their correctness 
  when the model is parsed to C++ and returns an error if they are not.
  Currently, there are five types of parameters in \pkg{brms} models, 
  for which the user can specify prior distributions. \cr
  
  1. Fixed and category specific effects 
  
  Every fixed (and category specific) effect has its own regression parameter. 
  These parameters are internally named as \code{b_<fixed>}, 
  where \code{<fixed>} represents 
  the name of the corresponding fixed effect. 
  Suppose, for instance, that \code{y} is predicted by \code{x1} and \code{x2} 
  (i.e. \code{y ~ x1+x2} in formula syntax). 
  Then, \code{x1} and \code{x2} have regression parameters 
  \code{b_x1} and \code{b_x2} respectively. 
  The default prior for fixed and category specific effects is an 
  improper flat prior over the reals. Other common options are normal priors 
  or student-t priors. If we want to have a normal prior with mean 0 and 
  standard deviation 5 for \code{x1}, 
  and a unit student-t prior with 10 degrees of freedom for \code{x2}, 
  we can specify this via
  \code{set_prior("normal(0,5)", class = "b", coef = "x1")} and \cr
  \code{set_prior("student_t(10,0,1)", class = "b", coef = "x2")}.
  To put the same prior on all fixed effects at once, 
  we may write as a shortcut \code{set_prior("<prior>", class = "b")}. 
  This also leads to faster sampling, because priors can be vectorized in this case. 
  Both ways of defining priors can be combined using for instance 
  \code{set_prior("normal(0,2)", class = "b")} and \cr
  \code{set_prior("normal(0,10)", class = "b", coef = "Intercept")}
  at the same time. This will set a \code{normal(0,10)} prior on 
  the Intercept and a \code{normal(0,2)} prior on all other fixed effects. 
  The intercept can have a separate prior without breaking vectorization. 
  However, this is not the case for other fixed effects.
  
  A special shrinkage prior to be applied on fixed effects is the horseshoe prior.
  It is symmetric around zero with fat tails and an infinitely large spike
  at zero. This makes it ideal for sparse models that have 
  many regression coefficients,although only a minority of them is non-zero. 
  For more details see Carvalho et al. (2009).
  The horseshoe prior can be applied on all fixed effects at once 
  (excluding the intercept) by using \code{set_prior("horseshoe(<df>)")}.
  Replace \code{<df>} with the desired degrees of freedom of the student-t prior
  of the local shrinkage parameters. 
  In their paper, Carvalho et al. (2009) use one degrees of freedom, but this
  my lead to an increased number of divergent transition in \pkg{Stan}
  so that slightly higher values may often be a better option. 
  Generally, models with horseshoe priors a more likely than other models
  to have divergent transitions so that increasing \code{adapt_delta} 
  from \code{0.8} to values closer to \code{1} will often be necessary.
  See the documentation of \code{\link[brms:brm]{brm}} for instructions
  on how to increase \code{adapt_delta}. \cr
  
  3. Autocorrelation parameters
  
  The autocorrelation parameters currently implemented are named 
  \code{ar} (autoregression), \code{ma} (moving average),
  and \code{arr} (autoregression of the response).
  The default prior for autocorrelation parameters is an 
  improper flat prior over the reals. 
  Other priors can be defined by \cr
  \code{set_prior("<prior>", class = "ar")} 
  for \code{ar} effects and similar for \code{ma} and \code{arr} effects.
  
  4. Standard deviations of random effects
  
  Each random effect of each grouping factor has a standard deviation named
  \code{sd_<group>_<random>}. Consider, for instance, the formula 
  \code{y ~ x1+x2+(1+x1|g)}.
  We see that the intercept as well as \code{x1} are random effects 
  nested in the grouping factor \code{g}. 
  The corresponding standard deviation parameters are named as 
  \code{sd_g_Intercept} and \code{sd_g_x1} respectively. 
  These parameters are restriced to be non-negative and, by default, 
  have a half cauchy prior with a scale parameter that depends on the 
  standard deviation of the response after applying the link function.
  Minimally, the scale parameter is 5. 
  To define a prior distribution only for standard deviations 
  of a specific grouping factor,
  use \cr \code{set_prior("<prior>", class = "sd", group = "<group>")}. 
  To define a prior distribution only for a specific standard deviation 
  of a specific grouping factor, you may write \cr
  \code{set_prior("<prior>", class = "sd", group = "<group>", coef = "<coef>")}. 
  Recommendations on useful prior distributions for 
  standard deviations are given in Gelman (2006). \cr
  
  5. Correlations of random effects 
  
  If there is more than one random effect per grouping factor, 
  the correlations between those random
  effects have to be estimated. 
  The prior \code{"lkj_corr_cholesky(eta)"} or in short 
  \code{"lkj(eta)"} with \code{eta > 0} 
  is essentially the only prior for (choelsky factors) of correlation matrices. 
  If \code{eta = 1} (the default) all correlations matrices 
  are equally likely a priori. If \code{eta > 1}, extreme correlations 
  become less likely, whereas \code{0 < eta < 1} results in 
  higher probabilities for extreme correlations. 
  Correlation matrix parameters in \code{brms} models are named as 
  \code{cor_(group)}, (e.g., \code{cor_g} if \code{g} is the grouping factor).
  To set the same prior on every correlation matrix, 
  use for instance \code{set_prior("lkj(2)", class = "cor")}.
  
  6. Parameters for specific families 
  
  Some families need additional parameters to be estimated. 
  Families \code{gaussian}, \code{student}, and \code{cauchy} 
  need the parameter \code{sigma} 
  to account for the residual standard deviation.
  By default, \code{sigma} has a half cauchy prior that scales 
  in the same way as the random effects standard deviations. 
  Furthermore, family \code{student} needs the parameter 
  \code{nu} representing the degrees of freedom of students t distribution. 
  By default, \code{nu} has prior \code{"gamma(2,0.1)"}
  and a fixed lower bound of \code{1}.
  Families \code{gamma}, \code{weibull}, \code{inverse.gaussian}, and
  \code{negbinomial} need a \code{shape} parameter that has a 
  \code{"cauchy(0,5)"} prior by default. 
  For families \code{cumulative}, \code{cratio}, \code{sratio}, 
  and \code{acat}, and only if \code{threshold = "equidistant"}, 
  the parameter \code{delta} is used to model the distance between 
  two adjacent thresholds. 
  By default, \code{delta} has an improper flat prior over the reals. \cr
  Every family specific parameter has its own prior class, so that \cr
  \code{set_prior("<prior>", class = "<parameter>")} it the right way to go.

  Often, it may not be immediately clear, 
  which parameters are present in the model.
  To get a full list of parameters and parameter classes for which 
  priors can be specified (depending on the model) 
  use function \code{\link[brms:get_prior]{get_prior}}.
