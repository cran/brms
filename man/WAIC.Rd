\title{Compute the WAIC}
\usage{
WAIC(x, ..., compare = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model object typically of class \code{brmsfit}.}

\item{...}{Optionally more fitted model objects.}

\item{compare}{A flag indicating if the WAICs of the models should be compared to each other.}
}
\value{
If just one object is provided, an object of class \code{ic}. 
If multiple objects are provided, an object of class \code{iclist}.
}
\description{
Compute the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion based on the posterior likelihood
by using the \pkg{loo} package
}
\details{
When comparing models fitted to the same data, the smaller the WAIC, the better the fit.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
#model with fixed effects only
fit_i1 <- brm(rating ~ treat + period + carry,
              data = inhaler, family = "gaussian")
WAIC(fit_i1)

#model with an additional random intercept for subjects
fit_i2 <- brm(rating ~ treat + period + carry + (1|subject),
             data = inhaler, family = "gaussian")
#compare both models
WAIC(fit_i1, fit_i2)
