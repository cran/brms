\title{Basic Bayesian Structural Time Series}
\usage{
cor_bsts(formula = ~1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A one sided formula of the form \code{~ t}, or \code{~ t | g}, 
specifying a time covariate \code{t} and, optionally, 
a grouping factor \code{g}. 
A covariate for this correlation structure must be integer valued. 
When a grouping factor is present in \code{formula}, the correlation structure 
is assumed to apply only to observations within the same grouping level; 
observations with different grouping levels are assumed to be uncorrelated. 
Defaults to \code{~ 1}, which corresponds to using the order of the observations 
in the data as a covariate, and no groups.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{cor_bsts}.
}
\description{
Add a basic Bayesian structural time series component to a brms model
}
\details{
Bayesian structural time series models offer an alternative 
  to classical AR(I)MA models (they are in fact a generalization).
  The basic version currently implemented in \pkg{brms} introduces
  local level terms for each observation, whereas each local level term 
  depends on the former local level term:
  \deqn{LL_t ~ N(LL_{t-1}, sigmaLL)}
  A simple introduction can be found in this blogpost: 
  \url{http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/04/21/forget-arima/}.
  More complicated Bayesian structural time series models may follow
  in the future.
